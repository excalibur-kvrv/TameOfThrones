<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>There is no ruler in the universe of Southeros and pandemonium reigns. Shan, the gorilla king of the Space kingdom wants to rule all Six Kingdoms in the universe of Southeros. He needs the support of 3 more kingdoms to be the ruler.<br/>
There is no ruler today and pandemonium reigns. Shan is sending secret messages to all kingdoms to ask for their allegiance. Your coding challenge is to help King Shan send the right message to the right kingdom to win them over. <br/>
Each kingdom has their own emblem and the secret message should contain the letters of the emblem in it. Once Shan has the support of 3 other kingdoms, he is the ruler!<br/>
